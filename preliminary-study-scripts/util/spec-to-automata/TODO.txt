- Write script to automate process of running that shows the automata picture
- Improve to take in a formatted automata table as well
- Make it take in two files instead of std in
- Run w checkstyle and make code neat --> probably need to work through a bit more
- Filter out unnecessary stdout and log
- Clear out classes and methods that I don't actually use
- Formattting
- (FUTURE): hopefully be able to do this for other kinds of formalisms? (that reduce down to FSMs)
+ Connect w dkbrics Automata
+ Probably want to output dot file of automaton at the end?
+ Dot file contains time in file name
